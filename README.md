# Meito-Mod
The Meito Mod is based on the meito, or swords of one piece. This mod is made up by 5 catagories: Grade, Skillful Grade, Great Grade, Supreme Grade, and because I don't want to clutter things up with custom haki blades, Haki Grade.
Grade: This catagory makes up most of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 35-50.  
Skillful Grade: This catagory makes up a chunk of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 50-80.  
Great Grade: This catagory makes up a small amount of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 120-150.  
Supreme Grade: This catagory makes up a very small amount of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 250-270.  Haki Grade:  Just a bunch of black swords!   DISCORD : https://discord.gg/w754wKmC
