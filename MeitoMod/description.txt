The Meito Mod is based on the meito, or swords of one piece.
This mod is made up by 5 catagories: Grade, Skillful Grade, Great Grade, Supreme Grade,
and because I don't want to clutter things up with custom haki blades, Haki Grade


Grade:
This catagory makes up most of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 35.

Skillful Grade:
This catagory makes up a chunk of the swords in this mod. All swords in this catagory do a base damage of 50.

Great Grade:

Supreme Grade:
